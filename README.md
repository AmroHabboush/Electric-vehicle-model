# Electric-vehicle-model
A basic model of an electric vehicle on Matlab simulink 
EVs are vehicles that are either partially or fully powered on electric power. Electric vehicles have low running costs as they have less moving parts for maintaining and also very environmentally friendly as they use little or no fossil fuels (petrol or diesel).
This project shows the basic idea of EV using Matlab simulink components.
